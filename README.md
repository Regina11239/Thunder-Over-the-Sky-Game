I plan to add new features to this game, such as a scoreboard, new kinds of enemies, animations and so on when I have time.

Honkai Impact 3 is an important game on my way to explore my passion in game development. Through playing it, I learned the skill of thinking as a game maker, rather than a player. It inspired me to explore the logics of game features, such as how to make different game levels, how to record when players/enemies are being hit, how to start and exit a game and so on. I am thankful to the experience Honkai has brought to me.

Below are some screenshots of the game, includes the title page(image 1) and game screen(image 2).
